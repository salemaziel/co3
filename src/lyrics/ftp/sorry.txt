Uuummm aaaaaaa

I’m so sorry
Ya I didn’t mean
to make you  go away

Air—

I’m so sorry 

For putting you ten feet 
Under ground

Sorry
I’m sorry you’ve gone away

Sorry
Didn’t mean to make you go

Down into the ground 
I put you there

Since you’ve gone away 
I miss your soul

Sorry
Down into the ground

Sorry
I didn’t mean to let you go   

LEAD—

Mmmmmmmm
The grass is always greener
Where I know you are
