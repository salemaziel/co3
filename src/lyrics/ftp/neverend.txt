Tik Tik Tik 

Take me to another place
Past the stars that never end
Stopping time all hands stand still.   
Never end this endless dream

Let’s rooooooooooll

Holding the hands of time 
Bleeding through your sole
As we fade away 
Never to return

Never to return 

Through the darkest night     
Wake the spirit light
Something there you cannot see 
Time that never ends
Time that never ends 
Never ends

Holding the hands of time 
Bleeding through your sole.     
And as we fade away 
Never to return

Never to return
Never to return

Let’s rooooooooll

Holding the hands of time 
Bleeding through your sole
As we fade away 
Never to return

Never to return...
