You get a piece of me 
ya taste so fine 
Yes I like to hold you down

As you move I turn        
Right on time 
O so fine

Shhhhhh

Don’t say a word 
Harder never deep enough
Shiver with delight
Rocking it through the night

Don’t say a word 
Harder never deep enough
Shiver with delight
Rocking it through the night

It’s not what we know 
It’s who we know
We thought it was good
So here’s what I got to say

Oooooo

Try to confuse me                 
In this state of mine
Try to abuse me
So easy you defy

Try to change my world
I blink you lie
Yes same o rumor in town
As you move on out
Right on time
O not again

Shhhhhh

Don’t say a word
Hammer beating in my 
Shiver to the bone
Were always good in bed

Another thing I must confess
You’re still a taker who never gives
This won’t happen
Ever again

Always a lie
You always deny

Try to confuse me                         
In this state of mine
Try to abuse me
So easily defy

You’re a taker who never gives back
Difficult and exhausting 
I’m over it..........
