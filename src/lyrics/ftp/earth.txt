Who am I                  
Who brings you light
Through the darkness
Of the night   

Oooooo  

Who am I     
What are we
Where do we go    
Why do we live
How much longer
For the eeeeeeearth

Who am I          
Who brings you light
Through the darkness
Of the night

Aaaaaa Aaaaaa Aaaa

WE WILL RETURN   


Through the night
Black or white
Makes no difference

Soooooooo

Without the light   

Who am I   
What are we
Where do we go   
Why do we live
How much longer     
For the eeeeearth

On the earth 
Do the good 
Aand good will be
Until the end of end

Aaaaaa Aaaaaa Aaaa

HuuRrrraaaaaaaaaa
