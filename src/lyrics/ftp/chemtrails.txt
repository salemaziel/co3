Hay hay
That’s a big old plane
White lines in the sky,
Making me wonder
Hay hay
Take the planes away
They dirty the sky
Making it Hotter
 
Big O cans flying through the sky
Sure know why it’s on my mind
We talk about a better way
All the lines all through the sky
 
When it all comes down to fait 
There’s nothing there that’s good for you                                        
They say the lines goanna make it rain  
It’s only a matter of time no lie

chem trails 

Protecting us from bad sun rays
Others say it’s such a haze
Carbon dioxide from the planes
Soot particulates are to blame

When it all comes down to fait 
There’s nothing there that’s good for you                                        
They say the lines goanna make it rain  
It’s only a matter of time no lie
