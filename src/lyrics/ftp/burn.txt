Hey Hey Hey 

Burn it
Burn it
Burn it to the ground      

Ashes -blowing in the wind
Smoke -burns through your eye’s
Dust -all through the air
Darkness -fall’s through the sky

Burn it   - Look around           
Burn it   - It’s falling down     
Burn it.   -To the ground             
Burn it   -We will all be 
Falling down

Axes   -Will lose controls 
Heat   -Will over load
Molten   -Rocks do explode, 
Then rumble beneath your-feet

Burn it    -Plumes of smoke
Burn it     -Until we choke
Burn it    -There Nothing left
Burn it.   -We will burn it to the ground

LEAD  

We will burn it to the ground
We will burn it to the ground
