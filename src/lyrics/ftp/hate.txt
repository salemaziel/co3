Hayyyyyyyyyy

Hate is my best friend
Hate is what I feel for you
Fear is what you see in me
Pain I have in store for you

Leave me alone
Let me be
Let me go

Is this what you want me to see
Is this what you wanted me to be
Look at what you’ve done to me
What are you doing to me
I want you to leave me alone
Get back.....

Haaaaa

Hate is my best friend
Hate is my best friend who’s lonely
I hate to be the only one
Don’t you know that I’m living in hell 

Is this what you wanted to see

Is this what you want me to be






I don’t understand 
Why don’t you let me out 

Ask your mother while you’re freaking me out 
I’ll find a way out to cure this disease
I’ve never seen the man on the moon 

ha ha ha ha

I hate you
Leave me alone 
I hate that you hate
What we want to be 
Is this what you wanted to see
Is this what you want me to be

LEAVE ME ALONE

You’re alone in the dark, 
ha ha ha ha ha
