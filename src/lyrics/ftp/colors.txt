I’m not an angel 
I never said I was
Some things are best                 left unsaid
Halfway through my life  
I’m still searching on
For something better than yesterday 

Mmmmmmmmm

Pathway through our lives
Youth were searching for
Never knowing what you’ll      find

If love could’ve saved us you’d still be here
You’re the life of the party Uninvited 
Stop preaching to the preacher we’ve all been around the block
It’s not our first rodeo              how far can we go

Red Yellow Green Blue are the Colors of our soles 

Life lives in memories from      the sunrise to the sun set  
Dose it matter after all we’re do we go from here
Can you really see - see where you’re going too
 
Walking to the edge of the earth to the top of the ice 
As it starts to crack slipping I’m falling down 
Better way of life 
In my life I’m nobody 
Cause I can’t spend it with you

What goes around comes around as it reaches through your soul

What you’ve done will come back to you

What you’ve done will surely be there

What goes around is what you reap in us all


What goes around

Will come back to you
Aaaaaaaa
