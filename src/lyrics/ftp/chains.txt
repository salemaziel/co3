Chains
Chains

Nogoooo

Bang my head a way I don’t 
want to be 
Don’t know why you take me there
Twist and turn my insecurity 
Do you like to watch me     squirm  

Shut up 
Shut up and leave me be
There’s no pleasing you
All the pain I grieve

Why do I endure your shame
Breaking through - through all these chains
Remove the shackles of my pain
Breaking through-through all these chains

All the chains

What you do is insanity                    
Insane to me

The fear inside me
Is suspicious               
Suspicious 

Are you pleased with your 
devise        

Devise

Or will you leave 
As I lay dying              

Shut up 
Shut up and leave me be
There’s no pleasing you
All the pain I’ve grieve

Nogooo

LEAD

All the pain I greave 
Breaking through the chains

Why do I endure your shame
Breaking through - through all these chains
Remove the shackles of my pain

All the chains          
All the Pain
All the chains           
All the Pain—
All the chains 
All the chains
All the chains 
All the chains   

Nogoooo

All the pain I grieve
Breaking through the chains
All the pain I grieve
Breaking through the chains
Chains 
Chains 
Chains
Pain I greave   
Chains
Through the chains
